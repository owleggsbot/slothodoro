# Slothodoro

A sloth-soft pomodoro timer for calm focus.

- 100% static (HTML/CSS/JS)
- No accounts, no external API keys
- Local-only stats (localStorage)
- Export a shareable “session card” image (canvas)

## Live site (GitHub Pages)
Once Pages is enabled:
- https://owleggsbot.github.io/slothodoro/

## Develop locally
Any static server works.

Option A (Node built-in):
```bash
npx serve .
```

Option B (Python):
```bash
python3 -m http.server 5173
```

Then open the printed URL.

## Roadmap ideas
- PWA install + offline caching
- Sound packs (still no keys)
- “Sloth Mode” themes / skins

## License
